# Doorkickers_FUBAR_Difficulty_Mod

**"Death is waiting around every corner. Only a madman would attempt this."
-Spec Ops: The Line**

Inspired by Spec Ops: The Line and the original Rainbow Six trilogy, FUBAR Difficulty Mod changes combat in Door Kickers to be highly lethal.

Die in one penetrating hit without wearing armor. Die in two penetrating hits if wearing armor.

Note that armor mechanics in Door Kickers are highly random. The chance that armor will protect you from a bullet is based on a percentage, and high-RoF weapons are more likely to pierce armor than low-RoF weapons because of this.

You can still die instantly if your armor is too weak or you get shot in an unprotected part of the armor (Ex. Raider Vest not protecting the sides).
